						<p class="intro">App based, ride sharing transportation providers such as Lyft, Curb, Hale, et. al, and of course Uber the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing company, has dominated the industry since its inception in 2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued at $51 billion, spurring increasing talks of the company filing for an IPO.</p>

						<h2>Opportunity</h2>
						<p>Passengers will take their rides IN CONTROL. Enter your location and destination place your “wish” price for the ride. We will make your “wish” price for the trip available to the network of providers.</p>
						<p>Drivers will take their business to the highest level nearby cars or cars would presumably quote more aggressive prices, resulting in the user securing the best cost for his trip.</p>
						<p>Many fleets have one way trips and their cars return empty, this approach will give them a chance to bid on offers that make sense. Bidding will be available for a short time (10-15 minutes). After bidding is “closed”, users will be still presented with an option of choosing from all companies based on $ and ETA for the desired destination.</p>
