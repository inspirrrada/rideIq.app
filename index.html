						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p class="intro">App based, ride sharing transportation providers such as Lyft, Curb, Hale, et. al, and of course Uber the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing company, has dominated the industry since its inception in 2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued at $51 billion, spurring increasing talks of the company filing for an IPO.</p>
						<p class="intro">More than 30 Billion Transportation Providers out there and more than 250 Million Passengers every day.</p>

						<h3>We have the ONLY <br>
							solution for it!</h3>
						<p class="intro-2">The idea, one platform that will gives you the expense or readiness based choice by quoting typical prices from many competing on-demand services for their rides. One app that displays competing quotes, organized by cost vs. time of arrival to the originating location.</p>

						<h2>Opportunity</h2>
						<p>Passengers will take their rides IN CONTROL. Enter your location and destination place your “wish” price for the ride. We will make your “wish” price for the trip available to the network of providers.</p>
						<p>Drivers will take their business to the highest level nearby cars or cars would presumably quote more aggressive prices, resulting in the user securing the best cost for his trip.</p>
						<p>Many fleets have one way trips and their cars return empty, this approach will give them a chance to bid on offers that make sense. Bidding will be available for a short time (10-15 minutes). After bidding is “closed”, users will be still presented with an option of choosing from all companies based on $ and ETA for the desired destination.</p>

						<h2>Product</h2>
						<p class="product-review">This optimizes the efficiency of his trip choices, thus making Price Pairing a must have option for the client to offer to his prospective users.

							<a href="#">Idea</a>
							<p class="idea-text">The idea of this platform is to create a customer App that will give people a choice of getting a ride from many competitors based on $ vs ETA. This platform also will give the customer an option to open bid for their trip. For example:</p>
							<p class="quote"><span>&rdquo;</span>I'm at AIRPORT and need to go to DOWNTOWN ; I select my FROM and TO and enter the price I’m willing to spend for that trip.</p>
							<p class="idea-text">App will show a suggested price based on lowest historical average for that route. Let’s say suggested price is $55, but I’m entering my “wish price” of $35. This gives companies a chance to bid on this offer if they have available cars at the same destination.</p>

				<div class="about-block">
					<div class="about-block-left">
						<p>As is often the case, the genesis of MoveAround Pro (M.A.P.) ( www.movearoundpro.com ) was inspired by the recognition of an unfilled marketplace need which, in the course of their industry experiences, was identified by the founders. That need - the development of a fully mobile, cloud based solution for app based car fleets - was the seed that gave birth to M.A.P. </p>
						<p>The company, with offices in NC and NY today, is a young software provider with a unique product concept ... </p>

					<div class="about-block-right">
						<h3>a suite of software tools to monitor and control on-demand ride booking and sharing and car flee operations</h3>

				<h2>Business model</h2>
				<p>The possibilities of this platform are endless and will take more than few pages to explain. But the main point is – with this approach; we become a direct competitor to Uber and Lyft, and will stop them from dominating the market. At the same time, we are giving a chance to smaller companies, which are suffering right now, to get out there and compete with prices and services they can provide.</p>
